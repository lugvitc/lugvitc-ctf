# React + TypeScript + Vite + tailwind

This template provides a minimal setup to get React and Tailwind working in Vite with HMR, formatting with Prettier and some ESLint rules.
## Setup

Install [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) if you haven't already.

```sh
npm install -g pnpm
```

Install dependencies.

```sh
pnpm install
```

Start the development server.

```sh
pnpm dev
```

Popular code editors will automatically format the code on save using the Prettier config. To format manually, run:

```sh
pnpm format
```
